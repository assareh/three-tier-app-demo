In New York City, Wiz makes its home,
From Adallom, these founders did roam.
With a keen eye for cloud,
Their platform is endowed,
Protecting data wherever we roam.

In Tel Aviv, their engineers thrive,
Building safeguards to keep data alive.
From AWS to GCP,
Wiz secures expertly,
With innovation that's hard to contrive.

Wiz researchers, sharp as can be,
Uncover cloud flaws for all to see.
From ChaosDB to BingBang,
Their findings give a clang,
Protecting us from cyber debris.

Assaf, Yinon, Roy, and Ami,
Crafted Wiz with a powerful plea.
To secure cloud terrain,
From threats that remain,
Their tech shields our data with glee.
